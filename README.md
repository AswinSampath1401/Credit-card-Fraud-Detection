# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
Detecting Fraudulent transactions originated from Credit Card
The dataset presented a typical resemblance of a practical scenario as it involved data imbalance (more non-fraudulent cases than fraudulent), 
hidden column names (to respect the privacy of its consumers) and demanded a highly accurate model without overfitting. 
The above 3 challenges were untangled by utilizing methods such as scaling and under sampling the dataset followed by finding correlation 
and anomalies using IQR (Inter Quartile Method) and dimensionality reduction. The refined data was passed on to various models out of which 
Logistic Regression gave us the best result of a 94% F1 score.
